# 3D-Maze-Navigation
A project led by the instructional team of CS 251 at Purdue University. Implemented a cyclic double-ended queue to map and solve a three-dimensional maze.
I worked on the implmentation in three files: cylic_double_queue.hpp, maze.hpp, and maze.cpp. The skeleton code was created by the CS251 instructional team.

Part 1: Double Ended Cyclic Queue:
  Implements a double ended cyclic queue that will allow enqueue and dequeue at both the front and back of the queue. 
  cylic_double_queue.hpp
Part 2a: Creating the Maze:
  Initializes the maze map for the player given the dimensions and the random seed for the map generation.
  maze.hpp and maze.cpp
Part 3a: Solving the Maze:
  Uses the generated maze to mark a path between the given start point and end point.
  maze.hpp and maze.cpp
